done  -- grad & Hess with Fourier basis functions
done  -- grad & Hess with Chebyshev basis functions

done - revise Fourier & Cheb classes

New Round of Things To Do:

-- procedural file that we can just import that has all the stuff to:
   - test procedures
   - generate data
   - train
   - test
   - make graphs etc

-- new technical functionality:
   - derivatives of obj w.r.t. initial condition
   - adding noise to data and then training
   - learning time-dependent potentials
